# ValheimExtended
ValheimExtended is a living collaborative project to create new and interesting mods for Valheim. The project is powered by [HarmonyX](https://github.com/BepInEx/HarmonyX) and [BepInExPack_Valheim](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/denikson/BepInExPack_Valheim/).

## Prerequisites
You need to use [BepInExPack_Valheim](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/denikson/BepInExPack_Valheim/) with your Valheim installation.

#Building it yourself
If you wish to build this assembly yourself, you need to run [Assembly Publicizer](https://github.com/CabbageCrow/AssemblyPublicizer/releases) on all game-specific libraries in your installation folder. 
These are the libraries prefixed with "assembly_" and can typically be found in "SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Valheim\valheim_Data\Managed"
For more information, see documentation for [HarmonyX](https://github.com/BepInEx/HarmonyX).

## ChatFixer
Chatfixer forces the chat window to become visible when a new message is received, this makes it much easier to keep track of chat in multiplayer.
